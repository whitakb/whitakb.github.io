    CSS
      Formatting
        Use soft tabs (2 spaces) for indentation.
        Prefer dashes over camelCasing in class names.
        Underscores and PascalCasing are okay if you are using BEM (see OOCSS and BEM below).
        Do not use ID selectors.
        When using multiple selectors in a rule declaration, give each selector its own line.
        Put a space before the opening brace { in rule declarations.
        In properties, put a space after, but not before, the : character.
        Put closing braces } of rule declarations on a new line.
        Put blank lines between rule declarations.

          border-radius:50%;
          border:2px solid white; }
          .no, .nope, .not_good {

          .avatar {
          border-radius: 50%;
          border: 2px solid white;
          }

          .one,
          .selector,
          .per-line {
          // ...
          }   

      Comments
        Prefer line comments (// in Sass-land) to block comments.
        Prefer comments on their own line. Avoid end-of-line comments.
        Write detailed comments for code that isn't self-documenting, such as:
          Uses of z-index
          Compatibility or browser-specific hacks

      OOCSS and BEM
        We encourage some combination of OOCSS and BEM for these reasons:

        It helps create clear, strict relationships between CSS and HTML
        It helps us create reusable, composable components
        It allows for less nesting and lower specificity
        It helps in building scalable stylesheets
        
        OOCSS, or “Object Oriented CSS”, is an approach for writing CSS that 
        encourages you to think about your stylesheets as a collection of “objects”: reusable, 
        repeatable snippets that can be used independently throughout a website.

          Nicole Sullivan's OOCSS wiki (https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki)
          Smashing Magazine's Introduction to OOCSS (http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/)

        BEM, or “Block-Element-Modifier”, is a naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS. 
        It was originally developed by Yandex with large codebases and scalability in mind, 
        and can serve as a solid set of guidelines for implementing OOCSS.

          CSS Trick's BEM 101 (https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/)
          Harry Roberts' introduction to BEM (http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/)

        We recommend a variant of BEM with PascalCased “blocks”, which works particularly well when combined with components 
        (e.g. React). Underscores and dashes are still used for modifiers and children.          

        Example

          // ListingCard.jsx
          function ListingCard() {
            return (
              <article class="ListingCard ListingCard--featured">

                <h1 class="ListingCard__title">Adorable 2BR in the sunny Mission</h1>

                <div class="ListingCard__content">
                  <p>Vestibulum id ligula porta felis euismod semper.</p>
                </div>

              </article>
            );
          }

          /* ListingCard.css */
          .ListingCard { }
          .ListingCard--featured { }
          .ListingCard__title { }
          .ListingCard__content { }

        .ListingCard is the “block” and represents the higher-level component
        .ListingCard__title is an “element” and represents a descendant of .ListingCard that helps compose the block as a whole.
        .ListingCard--featured is a “modifier” and represents a different state or variation on the .ListingCard block.

      ID selectors
        While it is possible to select elements by ID in CSS, it should generally be considered an anti-pattern. 
        ID selectors introduce an unnecessarily high level of specificity (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) to your rule declarations, 
        and they are not reusable.

        For more on this subject, read CSS Wizardry's article (http://csswizardry.com/2014/07/hacks-for-dealing-with-specificity/) on dealing with specificity.
        From this article:
          Never use IDs in CSS, ever. They have no advantage over classes (anything you can do with an ID, you can do with a class), they cannot be reused, and their specificity is way, way too high. Even an infinite number of chained classes will not trump the specificity of one ID.
          Do not nest selectors unnecessarily. If .header-nav {} will work, never use .header .header-nav {}; to do so will literally double the specificity of the selector without any benefit.
          Do not qualify selectors unless you have a compelling reason to do so. If .nav {} will work, do not use ul.nav {}; to do so would not only limit the places you can use the .nav class, but it also increases the specificity of the selector, again, with no real gain.
          Make heavy use of classes because they are the ideal selector: low specificity (or rather, all classes have the same specificity, so you have a level playing field), great portability, and high reusability.

      JavaScript hooks
        Avoid binding to the same class in both your CSS and JavaScript. Conflating the two often leads to, at a minimum, 
        time wasted during refactoring when a developer must cross-reference each class they are changing, and at its worst, 
        developers being afraid to make changes for fear of breaking functionality.

        We recommend creating JavaScript-specific classes to bind to, prefixed with .js-:

          <button class="btn btn-primary js-request-to-book">Request to Book</button>

      Border
        Use 0 instead of none to specify that a style has no border.

        Bad

          .foo {
            border: none;
          }

        Good

          .foo {
            border: 0;
          }

    From MDN

      Each property-value pair on a separate line

        h2 {
        background-color: black;
        color: white;
        }

      Comment your CSS


      Suggested sections:
        COMMON STYLES:

          Setup the common styling first. That is, you will typically have rules set up for:
            body
            p
            h1, h2, h3, h4, h5
            ul and ol
            The table properties
            Links

              /* || GENERAL STYLES */

              body {
              /* … */
              }

              h1,
              h2,
              h3,
              h4 {
              /* … */
              }

              ul {
              /* … */
              }

              blockquote {
              /* … */
              }  

        UTILITY STYLES
          define a few utility classes, for example, 
          a class that removes the default list style for lists we're going to display as flex items or in some other way. 
          If you have a few styling choices you know you will want to apply to lots of different elements, they can be put in this section.

            /* || UTILITIES */

            .nobullets {
            list-style: none;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
            }

            /* … */


        SITEWIDE
          Then we can add everything that is used sitewide. That might be things like the basic page layout, the header, navigation styling, and so on.

            /* || SITEWIDE */

            .main-nav {
            /* … */
            }

            .logo {
            /* … */
            }


        SPECIFIC STYLING
          Finally, we will include CSS for specific things, broken down by the context, page, or even component in which they are used.

            /* || STORE PAGES */

            .product-listing {
            /* … */
            }

            .product-box {
            /* … */
            }  

      Avoid overly-specific selectors. 

      Break larger stylesheets into multiple smaller ones
